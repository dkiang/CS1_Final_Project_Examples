## Examples of CS1 Final Projects

These are sample programs for the final project. Python files end in .py and may be run with the following:
`python filename.py`

C files end in .c and are already compiled. They may be run with the following:
`./filename`

### blackjack.py
This is a program that lets you play a card game called Blackjack on your computer! The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. In the game, you play against the computer, who is the dealer.

### connect-4.c
This program lets two players play the Connect-4 game on a computer. In Connect-4, players take turns to drop colored discs into a grid. The goal is to get four discs of the same color in a row, column, or diagonal. The program demonstrates how to create a simple game using a 2D array, handle user input, and check for a winner. It also shows how to print colored text in the terminal. 

### craps.py
This program is like a game that you can play on the computer. It's called Craps and it's like rolling two dice and trying to win money. You start with $1000 and you have to bet some of your money on each roll. Then the computer rolls the dice and adds up the numbers. If you get 7 or 11, you win! But if you get 2, 3, or 12, you lose. If you get any other number, that's your "point" and you keep rolling until you get the same number again (and you win) or you get 7 (and you lose).

### flash_cards.py
The overall purpose of the program is to provide the user with a series of math problems to solve based on the operator and difficulty level chosen by the user. The program demonstrates several functions, including generating random math questions, prompting the user for input, and evaluating the user's answers. It also demonstrates the use of lists and functions that take parameters.

### RBI.py
The overall purpose of the program is to simulate a baseball at-bat between a batter and a pitcher, based on their respective statistics. The program takes user inputs for the batter's batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and the pitcher's ERA (Earned Run Average), and then simulates the result of an at-bat using a simple weighted average calculation and random selection.

### reservations.py
This is a simple motel room reservation system. It helps you keep track of which rooms are already booked and lets us reserve a room if it's available. You can choose from three options: view reserved rooms, reserve a room, or quit. When you view reserved rooms, it shows you a list of occupied rooms. If you want to reserve a room, you enter the room number, and the program tells you if the room is available or already reserved. If it's available, it gets booked for you.

### restaurants.py
The program aims to ask the user for their favorite restaurants, store them in a list, and provide a random recommendation from the list whenever the user requests it.

### scrambled.py
The overall purpose of the program is to provide users with a word-guessing game. The program randomly selects a 6-9 letter word from a predefined list, scrambles it, and challenges the user to guess the original word. The program demonstrates list manipulation, user input, and function usage with different arguments for varying difficulty levels. 

### spaceship_path.c
This program helps a spaceship find the best path through a 10x10 grid of fuel costs from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner. It uses three methods: Dynamic Programming, Dijkstra's algorithm, and A* search. The program creates a random grid with fuel costs for each space, then asks the user to choose one of the methods to find the best path. The best path is the one that uses the least amount of fuel. The program shows the path on the grid and tells the user how much fuel it costs. The user can try different methods with the same grid, change the grid to a new random one, or exit the program.

### TODO.py
The program serves as a To-do List Manager that allows users to add items to their to-do list along with their priorities and then display the list sorted by priority.

### wordle.py (by our own TA, Isabel!)
An excellent demonstration of efficiency and brevity. Wordle with color output and she only used 50 lines of code!

### words.py
This is a word search game. The program generates a 10x10 grid filled with random capital letters and displays it to the user. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate how to create a grid, populate it with random letters, and print the resulting grid. The program showcases the use of nested loops, the rand() function to generate random numbers, and a custom function to fill the grid with random letters.
